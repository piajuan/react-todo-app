## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework


### What I learned

- How to setup a react project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- The basics of react hooks such as useState, useEffect and useRef
- How to toggle the dark/light mode using Tailwind and useState
- How to reorder items on a list onDrag event

### Continued development

I had some challenges figuring out how to implement the filter feature and it's something I want to improve on in my future projects.

I would like to acknowledge my partner who's also my mentor in React. He guided from the start, taught me some of the concepts of react hooks, and components. He also helped me when I'm stuck in some features of the project.
